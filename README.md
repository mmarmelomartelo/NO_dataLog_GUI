(# NO-dataLog-GUI)
*This is a basic Grafic User Interface based on Tkinter. The NO data Log will be used to collect data on real time from a serial port (analog to digital)


* The Figure below shown a graph generated on real time using the NO_dataLog_GUI

*__This is a python program reading real time data generated by a Arduino uno microcontroller plate. When I change the current using a potentiometer, the graph is updated on real time__ ðŸ˜‰
*__Next step is to merge with a tkinter GUI to simplify end user experience__
